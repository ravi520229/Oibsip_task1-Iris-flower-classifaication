# Oibsip_task1-Iris-flower-classifaication
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on classifying iris flowers into different species using Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), and Decision Tree algorithms. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the application of these algorithms in solving a classic classification problem.

Dataset
The project utilizes the well-known Iris dataset, which includes measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three different iris species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The dataset is commonly used as a benchmark for classification algorithms due to its simplicity and distinct species characteristics.

Algorithms
The classification task is performed using three popular algorithms:

Support Vector Machines (SVM): SVM is a powerful algorithm for binary and multi-class classification. It constructs a hyperplane or set of hyperplanes to separate data points belonging to different classes, maximizing the margin between them.

Logistic Regression (LR): LR is a widely used algorithm for binary classification that can be extended to handle multi-class problems. It models the relationship between the features and the probabilities of the different classes using a logistic function.

Decision Tree: Decision Tree is a tree-based algorithm that recursively partitions the feature space based on the attribute values. It creates a set of rules to make predictions by traversing the tree from the root node to the leaf nodes.

Usage
To run the classification algorithms and evaluate their performance, follow the instructions below:

Install the required dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.

Run the iris_classification.py script, which loads the dataset, preprocesses the data, trains the SVM, LR, and Decision Tree models, and evaluates their accuracy on a held-out test set.

Experiment with different hyperparameters, feature engineering techniques, or other modifications to improve the classification results.

Feel free to explore the code, understand the implementation details, and adapt it for your own classification tasks.
